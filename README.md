# Text-Classification-Using-Python-and-ML

This project involves text classification using various machine learning techniques in Python. The aim is to classify text data into predefined categories or labels.

## Introduction

Text classification, also known as text categorization, is the process of assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. It is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and has various applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including removing noise, stopwords, and punctuation, as well as stemming or lemmatizing words.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings (such as Word2Vec).

3. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models on the extracted features to classify text data. This project explores models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Word2Vec-based classifiers.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Deployment**: Testing the trained model on new data and generating predictions. Saving the model and deploying it for real-world applications.

## Libraries Used
